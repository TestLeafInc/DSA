	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes / No
	 * 
	 * 	-> If you understand the problem --> what to follow
	 *  -> If you do not understand the problem --> Ask for more !! 
	 * 
	 * 	A) Ask for an example !
	 *  B) Re-confirm the input, output
	 *  C) Are there any constraints?
	 *  
	 * 2) Derive your test data
	 * 
	 *  - Minimal 3 test data set
	 *  - Positive, Edge, Negative
	 *  - Validate with your interviewer !!
	 *  
	 * 3) Do I know how to solve this?
	 * 
	 *  - Ask for time (15 sec - 60 sec)
	 *  = Create trust and transparency
	 *  = Yes (great --> do I know multiple solutions?)
	 *  = No (Sorry, Can I have some hints?)
	 *  
	 * 4) Ask for hints !!
	 * 
	 *  - Put it nicely
	 *  - Never leave a big silence between you and interviewer
	 *  = Sorry, I could not make it? Can i have another question?
	 *  
	 *  Tip: Sorry, I do not know the approach. But making a note of it !!
	 *  I will go back and work on this today.
	 *  
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solutions?  
	 *  
	 *  - Yes, How many?
	 *  - No (It is okay to have one solution)
	 * 
	 * 6) If you know more than one?
	 * 
	 * 	- Explain the approaches 
	 * 	- What O Notations (Space and Time Complexity)
	 *  - Which solution is better and why?
	 *  - Ask interviewer which approach to apply?
	 * 
	 * Hint: Start small / brute force !!
	 * 
	 *  - Start with worst !
	 *  - Optimize !
	 *  - This is my final optimized !
	 *  
	 *  7) Start with Psuedo code
	 *  
	 *  = Basic english (keywords)
	 *  - Step by step approach
	 *  
	 *  8) Implement the code 
	 *  
	 *  - Most of the interviewers --> Notepad / Eclipse
	 *  - Keep talking while writing 
	 *  
	 *  9) Test against different test data set
	 *  
	 *  - Confirm it is working for each test data set
	 *  
	 *  10) Debug them to solve it !
	 *  
	 *  - Use breakpoints, watch, variables to confirm what is wrong
	 *  - Fix and run
	 *
